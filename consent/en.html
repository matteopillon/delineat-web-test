        <p>
            This policy details how this site uses cookies as well as cookie-type files and technologies on its
            websites, for example Local Shared Objects, also known as "Flash cookies", Web beacons, etc.. We
            will refer to these generally as "cookies". If you visit our website and your browser settings accept
            cookies, the use of our cookies will be deemed accepted.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cookies are small files sent and stored on your computer by websites you visit. Cookies are stored
            in the file directory of your browser. The next time you visit the site, your browser will read the
            cookie and relay the information back to the website or entity that originally created the cookie. To
            learn more about these technologies and how they work, visit, for example, allaboutcookies.org.
        </p>
        <p>
            The session cookies used in this site avoid the use of other computer techniques that could
            potentially compromise the confidentiality of users' navigation and do not allow the acquisition of
            personal identification data of the user.

        </p>
        <p>
            The retention time of the acquired data depends on the types of cookies. Session cookies expire
            when you close your browser. Persistent cookies, including Local Shared Objects ﴾"Flash cookies"﴿,
            have typical expiration dates ranging from two months to a couple of years.

            How to disable cookies (opt-out)
        </h2>
        <p>
            Most internet browsers are initially set to accept cookies automatically. This means that you have
            the option, at any time, to set your browser to accept all cookies, only some of them, or to reject
            them by disabling their use by the sites. In addition, you can normally set your browser preferences
            so that you are notified whenever a cookie is stored on your computer. Finally, at the end of each
            browsing session, you can delete the cookies collected from your device's hard drive. If you want to
            delete the cookies installed in the cookie folder of your browser, please note that each browser has
            different procedures for managing your settings.

            The so-called "technical" cookies, for which no consent to their processing is required, are to be
            considered the following:
        </p>
        <p>
            a) Cookies relating to activities strictly necessary for the operation of the site and the provision of
            the service: these are cookies designed to ensure the normal navigation of the site. In most cases
            they are session cookies.
        </p>
        <p>
            b) Functionality cookies, related to optimization activities: are cookies that allow the user to browse
            the site according to the selected criteria (such as language, currency, shopping cart content during
            online purchases) in order to allow the use of the services rendered and/or to improve them. In most
            cases, these cookies have a maximum duration of 365 days.
        </p>
        <p>
            All technical cookies do not require consent, so they are installed automatically after you access the
            site and are not used for any further purposes.

            Services and cookies provided by Third Parties
        </h2>
        <p>
            In the case of services provided by third parties, you may also exercise your right to object to
            tracking by informing yourself via the third party's privacy policy, via the opt-out link if explicitly
            provided or by contacting the third party directly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Notwithstanding the above, the Owner informs you that you can use Your Online Choices
            (http://www.youronlinechoices.com/). Through this service you can manage the tracking
            preferences of most advertising tools. The Owner, therefore, recommends that you use this resource
            in addition to the information provided in this document.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since the installation of Cookies and other tracking systems operated by third parties through the
            services used within this Site cannot be technically controlled by the Owner, any specific reference
            to Cookies and tracking systems installed by third parties is to be considered indicative. For
            complete information, please refer to the privacy policy of any third party services.
        </p>
        <p>
            Given the objective complexity linked to the identification of Cookie-based technologies and their
            very close integration with the functioning of the web, you are invited to contact the Owner if you
            would like to receive any further information on the use of Cookies and any use of the same - for
            example by third parties - made through this site.
